# Newsletter-Signup

Deployed with Heroku @ https://serene-chamber-92109.herokuapp.com/

Created with Node and Express, this project integrates the Mailchimp API to subscribe users for my newsletter.

I should note here: although I created this project from a course that does give some guidance, the course was created in 2018 and the API has changed quite a bit.
That's okay with me: I'm here to build my skills, so I did a lot of digging around the API myself, exploring params, authentication, and endpoints.
There are other areas where I debugged or did my work completely independently, such as setting up Express to serve static files or finding a workaround for the Jumbotron
(as current Bootstrap no longer features Jumbotrons). 

Enjoy! (And if you subscribe to my albeit-nonexistent newsletter, my audience page on Mailchimp will actually receive your input and I'll see an email on my audience page. I've tested this by creating users on my end. ;))

Note: I removed the API key from the code because Mailchimp disables it for being public if I don't.
